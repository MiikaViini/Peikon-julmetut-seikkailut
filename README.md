# Peikon julmetut seikkailut

During my time studying game development at Amiedu, I participated in our first group project. For the project, I was responsible for writing the source code and working with Unity, while two other team members provided the art. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide all the Unity files, but I have included all the C# files that I created. Additionally, I have provided a .zip file so that you can play the game on your Windows machine.

I used Fmod for implement sounds and music. I dont own any right for arts or music.
