# Peikon julmetut seikkailut

As i was studying game developing in Amiedu, this was our first group project.
I did source code and operated with Unity, art came from 2 different people.
That been said, i cant provide all files for Unity, but there is all C# files that 
i created. Also i provide .zip so you can play it with your Windows machine.

I used Fmod for implement sounds and music. I dont own any right for arts or music.
